 - A function has "constant" growth if its output does not change based on the input, the nnn. 
The easy way to identify constant functions is find those that have no nnn in their expression anywhere, or have n^0n 
 - A function has "linear" growth if its output increases linearly with the size of its input. 
The way to identify linear functions is find those where nnn is never raised to a poweror used as a power. 
 - A function has "polynomial" growth if its output increases according to a polynomial expression. 
The way to identify polynomial functions is to find those where nnn is raised to some constant power.
 - A  function has "exponential" growth if its output increases according to an exponential expression. 
The way to identify exponential functions is to find those where a constant is raised to some expression involving nn
